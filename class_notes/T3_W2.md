## React Intro Part 1   

React is a framework for building frontends 

* App updates without having to refresh 
* Internal tool used by FB 
* Open source
 
## React Intro Part 2

npx create-react-app nameofapp
 
<strong>Folder Structure</strong>

src === where our code goes 
node_modules === where our libraries go
package.json === lists our dependencies and scripts 

Define a port in <strong>.env.development</strong> to avoid Rails clashing 

        PORT = 8080
        BROWSER = NONE 

Add this file in <strong>.gitignore</strong> under # misc

         
        .env.development

## React Intro Part 3

        yarn start 

Starts the react application in a development application 
This is a script that is contained in package.json

View at 

        localhost:8080


<!-- In <strong>index.js</strong> remove import from ./app and change the 

        ReactDOM.reender(
            <App />
            document.getElementById('root')
        );

to 

          ReactDOM.reender(
            <h1>hello world!</h1>
            document.getElementById('root')
        ); -->


Delete logo.svg, reportWebvitals.js, setupTests.js, App.tst.js, App.css, index.css files. 

## React Intro Part 4

 
In <strong>App.js</strong>

        // functional component

        function App() {
            return (
                <h1> Hello World</h1>
            );
        }

Parentheses () are where you write your JS code 

        export default App;

Is imported in index.js

        import App from './App';

If you want to render out an entire component you use the xml notation

        <App />


Use the <strong>Nav.jsx</strong> to hold your components. In this example we'll create a navigation component called...

        Nav.jsx 

...

        import React from 'react'

        const Nav = () => {
            return (
                <nav>
                    <a href="/">Home</a>
                    <a href="/">About</a>
                    <a href="/">Projects</a>
                 </nav>   

            )
        }

        export default Nav; 

If you want to use the nav in another file such as App.js you import it with 

        import Nav from './Nav'

To show the component in App.js use the xml notation 

        const App = () => {
            return (
                <div>
                    <NAV />
                    <h1>Hello world</h1>
                </div>
            );
        }


        export default App;


Create another component in this case we'll call it Main.jsx

        import React from 'react'

        const Main = () => {
            return (
                <main>
                    <h1>hello world</h1>
                    <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
                </main>
            )
        }

To show this component in App.js you need to import it first 

        import React from 'react'
        import Nav from './Nav'
        import Main from './Main'


        const App = () => {
            return (
                <div>
                    <NAV />
                    <h1>Hello world</h1>
                </div>
            );
        }


        export default App;


## Class Components, State and Lifecycle 

<strong>What is a component</strong>

A component is a smallest unit of a web pave which can be configured, reused and nested. 

A component can be thought of as a function that returns html elements 

<strong>How to design a component</strong>

configurable, nested, reuse. 

<strong>What is a State</strong>

Each time a state value is updated, it triggers the page to rerender.
Only the part of the component that is changed rerenders. 

<strong>Class Components</strong>

<strong>Build a clock app</strong>

<strong>Lifecycle Methods</strong>
A component lifecycle from the time its mounted to its unmounted, its divided into various lifecycle methods 

![Screenshots](./docs/9.png "screenshots")

<ol>
        <li>componentDidMOunt : which runs after the first rerender <br><strong> best place to make API calls</strong></li><br>
        <li>componentDidUpdate : this runs after the subsequent rerender, not on the first render, provided prevState is different to the newState. <br><strong> if there is any repetitive tasks this would be the best place like (setInterval)</strong></li><br>
        <li>componentWillUnmount : runs towards end of the component lifecycle.<strong> <br>clear any background tasks running for this component like (clear interval)</strong> </li>

</ol>
