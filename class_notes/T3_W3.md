## React Hooks 

### State and Lifecycle Hooks 

Keeping track of the input fields in the component through the state

<strong>What are hooks?</strong>

* Introduced in Feb 2019 with v16.8

* Intended to enable functional components to be as feature rich as class components 

  * Provide a way to use state and override lifecycle methods 
  * Enable definition of custom hooks that can be reused 
  * Makes it easier to define modular code 

* A hook is a function 

<strong>Rules of hooks</strong>

* Hooks can only be used in functional components (or in custom hooks)
* Hooks must be used at the top level of the function 
  * They cannot be called in loops, conditionals, or nested functions 

<strong>The useState hook</strong>

* Called with the default state value for a piece of state 
* Returns an array with 2 items
    * The state variable 
    * The set function 

* Best practices is to use a separate state hook for each state item 

Import useState function in react 

        import React, {useState} from 'react'


<strong>The effect hook</strong>

* The effect hook provides access to override the lifecycle methods: 
    * componentDidMount
    * componentDidUpdate 
    * componentWillUnmount 

* Executed once on componentDidMount
* Executed optionally on componentDidUpdate
    * By default, executes on every render!
* Executes another optional function on componentWillUnmount 


<strong>The useEffect hook</strong>

* Called with a callback function, and optional array of trigger values 
* By default callback function executed on every single component render!
* Limit execution using the optional array of trigger values 
    * Empty array means it only executes once on componentDidMount 
* Callback function optionally returns another callback function to be executed on componentDidMount 
    * If needed for cleanup 

## Reducer

<strong>What is the reducer hook?</strong>

* The useReducer hook
* Used for state management 
* Allows more flexibility than the useState hook 
* Pattern mimics Redux 
* Significantly more complicated than useState, but powerful 

<strong>Why use a reducer?</strong>

* Complex state management logic 
    * When just 'set' to replace the entire value is not sufficient 
* Cleaner state management interface 
    * Define 'actions' that can be performed on state to change it 
* Global state implementation 
    * Provides a way to abstract state management for sharing globally with React Context 

<strong>The useReducer hook</strong>

* Takes two arguments - a reducer function and an initial state (and an optional third argument for an init function to initialize state).
* The reducer is a Redux-style reducer function of the form (state, action) => newState 
* The useReducer hook returns an array with the current state (like useState) and a dispatch function for calling the reducer function (like Redux)

<strong>Call to useReducer</strong>

        const [store, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

It is a common practice to use store as the name of the current state object, and dispatch as the function used to change the state in Redux. 

<strong>What is the reducer function?</strong>

* It is a function that is used to change application state 
* It follows a particular pattern 
* It can be called with the dispatch function returned by useReducer 

<strong>How the reducer function works</strong>

* The reducer function takes the current state, and an action to perform on the state (including the updated data for the action)
* It returns a new copy of the state, with the changes dictated by the action 
* If the action is unrecognised or invalid, it will just return the current state. 

 <strong>Reducer function pattern</strong>

        function reducer(state, action) {
            // The reducer uses the action type field to decide what happens 
            switch (action.type) {
                // Do something here based on the different types of actions 
                case 'setProjects' : {
                    return {
                        ...state,
                        projects: action.data
                    }
                }
                default:
                // If this reducer doesn't recognise or care about this specific action, return the existing state unchanged 
                return state 
            }
        }

* Signature 
* switch(action.type)
* case for each type
* Return new state object with change 
* Default to returning current state 

 <strong>Reducer function parameters</strong>

        function reducer(state, parameters)

This state parameter is the current state object 

The action parameter is an object with two properties:

        type
A string label for the action to perform on state 

        Data 

The updated data that will be applied to the current state 

 <strong>action.type</strong>

        switch (action.type) {
The action.type is a string that identifies what action we want to perform on the state 

If the action.type is not recognised, the current state is returned in the default statement '

        default:
            return state 

 <strong>action.data</strong>

        case 'setProjects': {
            return {
                ...state,
                projects: action.data
            }
        }

Updated state data is passed through action.data, and is used in the action clause to update the state appropriately

 <strong>Defining State</strong>

It is a common practice to use a state object with properties for each piece of state with useReducer 

        const intialState = {
            projects: []
        }

Rather than separate state objects for each piece of state with useState 

        const initialState = []
        const [projects, setProjects] = useState(initialState)

 <strong>Accessing State</strong>

        const [store, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
        const {projects} = store

Since state is implemented as an object with properties for each piece of state, it needs to be accessed a little differently.

Some people like to use destructing to define separate variables for each piece of state.

 <strong>Modifying State</strong>

We call dispatch (the function returned by useReducer) with an action to make changes to state. 

The reducer function will be called by dispatch with the current state and action.

The reducer function will update the current state based on the action.

        dispatch({
            type: 'setProjects',
            data: projects
        })
