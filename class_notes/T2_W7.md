# JavaScript Term 2 Week 7

## Objects 

        console.log

Used to output something to the developer console not to the webpage directly.

        console.log("Hello, world!")


        var a = 1

var = variables 

        let b = 2 

To find length of strings 

    name.length 
    = 3

To find object at index 

    "Hello".charAt(1)
    = "e"

String interpolation 

    My name is ${name}

    = "My name is Bob"

All numbers are floats in JS unlike Ruby  e.g. 

    1/2 
    = 0.5 

Comparison operators

    123 == "123" 
    = true 
JS will convert one object to match the other object in order to compare

To prevent type coersion use the triple ====

    123 === "123"
    = false 

To extract a value from a hash you can use the dot notation 

    person.age 
    = 40 

or 

    person["age"]
    =40 

In JS like many other languages you declare an array using [] brackets e.g. 

    const arr = ["Matt", 48, 4510]

Arrays are always indexed starting at 0 e.g. 

    arr[1]
    = 48 

To find how many elements are in the array use the length method

    arr.length 
    = 3

To add a new element to the array use the push method 

    arr.push("Hello")
    =  ["Matt", 48, 4510, "Hello']

To remove the item on the end of the array use the method pop

    arr.pop() 
    = "Hello"

    arr = ["Matt", 48, 4510]


## Control Flow 

        if 
        if else 
        if elseif 
        while 
        switch 
        for 

JS Example 

    if (condition) {
        // block of code 
    }


 ## Falsey Values 
    
    false 
    0 
    ""
    NaN
    null 
    undefined 

Anything that is not falsey is truthy
